# element-font-awesome

> This project demonstrates how to integrate Font Awesome icons into Element

Font Awesome provides `less` and `SCSS` files. Basically you need to change its icons' prefix, which is a variable in both formats, to `el-icon-xx`. Check `src/style.less` out for more details.

Run `npm run dev` to see it in the browser.
